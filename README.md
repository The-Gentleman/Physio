# README

Welcome to Physio! This Rails application seeks to allow rehabilitative therapists the ability to view a particular location and within that location, add patients and give them a diagnosis. 
The Ruby version is currently 2.6.1 and uses sqllite as a database. This application utilizes bcrypt to ensure user security, omniauth to streamline login, MVC architecture, and CSS for leeker UX. To run, fork and clone, then simply run rails -s.
This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.
